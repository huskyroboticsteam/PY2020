# Doxygen Tags directory

This directory is for .tag files which contain the list of symbols in
external libraries that are documented using Doxygen, so that we can
link to them in our documentation. See [Linking to External
Documentation](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/external.html) in the
Doxygen manual for more information.
